# Expo WebBrowser openBrowserAsync Unexpected Behavior and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `expo-web-browser` library's `openBrowserAsync` function.  The function may not always behave as expected, leading to unexpected application behavior or silent failures.  This issue is more likely to occur on specific Android devices or due to unusual browser configurations.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution that includes error handling and better management of asynchronous operations.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `expo start`. 
5. Interact with the app and observe the console output for potential errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates improved error handling and a more reliable way to use `openBrowserAsync`.
