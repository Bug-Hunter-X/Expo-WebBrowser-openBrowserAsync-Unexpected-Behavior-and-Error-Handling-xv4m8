import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';

async function handlePress() {
  let result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://example.com');
  console.log({result});
}

This code might cause issues in specific situations, such as when the user's device lacks a default browser or the browser is improperly configured.  Additionally, the `openBrowserAsync` function might not behave consistently across all platforms supported by Expo.
